# Frequency Counter Pattern

## Overview
The **Frequency Counter Pattern** is a problem-solving technique that utilizes objects (or hash maps) to track the frequency of values, improving efficiency by reducing time complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n).

## How It Works
1. Create an object to count the frequency of elements.
2. Populate the object by iterating through the collection.
3. Use the object to compare frequencies or check conditions.

## Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Reduces time complexity and avoids nested loops.
- **Simplicity**: Results in cleaner and more readable code.
- **Versatility**: Applicable to various problems, such as array comparisons and finding duplicates.

## Use Cases
- Comparing two arrays for squared values.
- Checking if two strings are anagrams.
- Finding duplicates in an array.

## When to Use
Use the Frequency Counter Pattern when comparing collections based on element frequencies, especially for larger datasets where performance is critical.
